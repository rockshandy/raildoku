== Welcome to Raildoku!

Rails is a web-application framework that includes everything needed to create
database-backed web applications according to the Model-View-Control pattern.

This pattern splits the view (also called the presentation) into "dumb"
templates that are primarily responsible for inserting pre-built data in between
HTML tags. The model contains the "smart" domain objects (such as Account,
Product, Person, Post) that holds all the business logic and knows how to
persist themselves to a database. The controller handles the incoming requests
(such as Save New Account, Update Product, Show Post) by manipulating the model
and directing data to the view.

== Code Files

The main heavy lifting is done by the files in lib/sudoku_ext where we have two
files

1.  constraint_sudoku - has some underlying libraries for constraint checking
2.  local_search - which can use constraint_sudoku to help with a local search
    heuristic plan

Both of the above are seperated into modules, and if you require the second
you can access anything in the first.
